## Code Contribution Guidelines

To maintain code consistency and facilitate a smooth contribution process, please follow these guidelines when submitting code:

1. **Open an Issue:** Before starting work on a new feature or bug fix, open an issue on GitHub to discuss the changes you plan to make. This allows for better coordination and avoids duplication of efforts.

2. **Fork and Branch:** Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes. This keeps your work separate from the main repository and allows for easy tracking of your contributions.

3. **Atomic Commits:** Make atomic commits with clear commit messages explaining your changes. Each commit should represent a single logical change to the codebase.

4. **Clear and Concise Code:** Write clear and concise code, following the established coding style and conventions used in the project. Use meaningful variable and function names to enhance readability.

5. **Comments and Documentation:** Add appropriate comments to explain complex logic or tricky parts of the code. Include inline documentation to help other contributors understand the purpose and usage of classes and functions.

6. **Testing:** Test your changes thoroughly to ensure they do not introduce new issues. Write unit tests to cover new functionality and ensure existing tests pass.

7. **Pull Request:** Submit a pull request from your branch to the main repository's "main" branch. Include a detailed description of your changes and reference the relevant issue if applicable.

8. **Be Open to Feedback:** Be open to feedback and constructive criticism. Reviewers may suggest improvements to your code, and collaboration leads to a better end result.

9. **Requesting a Pull Request Review:** If you have made significant changes or want to discuss the proposed contribution before submitting a pull request, you can request a pull request review. This allows other contributors to provide feedback and engage in the discussion before merging the changes.

I would also like to extend a heartfelt **Thank you** to all contributors. Your efforts, whether big or small, play a significant role in making this project better for everyone. We appreciate your time, dedication, and support in building and improving the [Library Management System](https://github.com/CheetahCodes21/Java-Library-Management-System.git).
